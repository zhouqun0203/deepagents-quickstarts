# 🚀 Developer Agent

## 🚀 Quickstart

**Prerequisites**: Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Ensure you are in the `developer` directory:
```bash
cd developer
```

Install packages:
```bash
uv sync
```

Set your API keys in your environment:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here  # Required for Claude model - or you could use any LLM model youw ant
export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here        # Required for web search ([get one here](https://www.tavily.com/)) with a generous free tier
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key_here  # [LangSmith API key](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) (free to sign up)
```

## Usage Options

You can run this quickstart in two ways:

### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook

Run the interactive notebook to step through building the agent:

```bash
uv run jupyter notebook develoer_agent.ipynb
```

### Option 2: LangGraph Server

Run a local [LangGraph server](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/langgraph-platform/local-server/) with a web interface:

```bash
langgraph dev
```

LangGraph server will open a new browser window with the Studio interface, which you can submit your requirements for an application to:

You can also connect the LangGraph server to a [UI specifically designed for deepagents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deep-agents-ui):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents-ui.git
$ cd deepagents-ui
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```

Then follow the instructions in the [deepagents-ui README](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents-ui?tab=readme-ov-file#connecting-to-a-langgraph-server) to connect the UI to the running LangGraph server.

This provides a user-friendly chat interface and visualization of files in state.

### Custom Model

By default, `deepagents` uses `"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"`. You can customize this by passing any [LangChain model object](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/). See the Deepagents package [README](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents?tab=readme-ov-file#model) for more details.

```python
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

# Using Claude
model = init_chat_model(model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", temperature=0.0)

# Using Gemini
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
model = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-3-pro-preview")

agent = create_deep_agent(
    model=model,
)
```

### Custom Instructions

The agent uses custom instructions defined in `developer/developer_agent/prompts.py` that complement (rather than duplicate) the default middleware instructions. You can modify these in any way you want. 


### Custom Tools

The deep research agent adds the following custom tools beyond the built-in deepagent tools. You can also use your own tools, including via MCP servers. See the Deepagents package [README](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents?tab=readme-ov-file#mcp) for more details.

| Tool Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `tavily_search` | Web search tool that uses Tavily purely as a URL discovery engine. Performs searches using Tavily API to find relevant URLs, fetches full webpage content via HTTP with proper User-Agent headers (avoiding 403 errors), and returns the complete content without summarization to preserve all information for the agent's analysis. 
| `fetch_webpage_content` | Fetches the content at a webpage and converts it to a human and LLM-friendy markdown format.
